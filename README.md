# On-Device Identity Card Field Text Extraction

This project involves generating a synthetic dataset using image augmentation techniques and sample data generation libraries such as Faker. Various YOLO models (v8s, v8n, v9t, v10n) were trained on the dataset. The project also incorporates text and object detection using Tesseract OCR and EasyOCR to extract information from documents accurately.
